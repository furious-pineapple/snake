# Snake

Always wanted to build a snake game so I built a snake game. Functional but has some quirky bugs I'm going to say are "features" Some collisions aren't recognized and the snake occasionally runs past the food without eating it (maybe he wasn't hungry). May or may not come back to finish styling and fix bugs 🤷🏽‍♂️.
